                    <h3><u>AIM OF NCC</u></h3><br>
                    The ‘Aims’ of the NCC laid out in 1988 have stood the test of time and continue to meet the
                    requirements expected of it in the current socio–economic scenario of the country. The NCC aims at
                    developing character, comradeship, discipline, a secular outlook, the spirit of adventure and ideals
                    of selfless service amongst young citizens. Further, it aims at creating a pool of organized,
                    trained and motivated youth with leadership qualities in all walks of life, who will serve the
                    Nation regardless of which career they choose. Needless to say, the NCC also provides an environment
                    conducive to motivating young Indians to join the armed forces.
